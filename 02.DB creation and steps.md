####  DB Creation 
Step-1:In DB creation we have four steps
Step-2:* Manual
       * OMF(Oracle Managed Files)
       * DBCA(Database Configuration Assistant)
       * DB creation using DBCA - Silent Method
Step-3:After creating  a DB with any method we can be run the database


####   Manual
Step-1:create one database with the name
Step-2:Specify an Instance Identifier (SID) and set all global environment variables
Step-3:Ensure That the Required Environment Variables Are Set
Step-4:Create the Initialization Parameter File(in the dbs location)
Step-5:Prepare CREATE DATABASE Statement script(in any location)
Step-6:connect to the database and start in nomount state
     * if there is any error in pfile it can't start
     *if pfile had no mistakes it will start
Step-7:create the database in DBlevel
     * if any error in script file it can't be created
     * if their is no errors it will created
Step-8:Run Scripts to Build Data Dictionary Views
      @?/rdbms/admin/catalog.sql
      @?/rdbms/admin/catalog.sql
      @?/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql
Step-9:Dba_objects status have to check
step-10:we have to run the scripts with "SYSYEM USER"
        @?/sqlplus/admin/pupbld.sql
    .......DB HAS BEEN CREATAED..........


##### OMF(Oracle Managed Files)
Step-1:create one database with the name
Step-2:Specify an Instance Identifier (SID) and set all global environment variables
Step-3:Ensure That the Required Environment Variables Are Set
Step-4:Create the Initialization Parameter File(in the dbs location)
       *IN the pfile we can't create a controlfile we can mention it afterpupbld.sql

Step-5:Prepare CREATE DATABASE Statement script(in any location)
Step-6:connect to the database and start in nomount state
     * if there is any error in pfile it can't start
     *if pfile had no mistakes it will start
Step-7:create the database in DBlevel
     * if any error in script file it can't be created
     * if their is no errors it will created
Step-8:Run Scripts to Build Data Dictionary Views
      @?/rdbms/admin/catalog.sql
      @?/rdbms/admin/catalog.sql
      @?/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql
Step-9:Dba_objects status have to check
step-10:we have to run the scripts with "SYSYEM USER"
        @?/sqlplus/admin/pupbld.sql
Step-11:Check the controlfile location and mention it on the pfile after that shut immediate and restart the session.      
    .......DB HAS BEEN CREATAED..........
  

  ####  DBCA(Database Configuration Assistant)
  Step-1:Open a GUI supported tool  Oracle s/w should be installed prior to the db creation
  Step-2:Go throw the home location and go to bin location
         ex:$cd /u01/app/oracle/product/19c/bin
  Step-3:then go throw ./dbca location in bin
  Step-4:Create the database steps in VMWare

  ####  DB creation using DBCA - Silent Method
  Step-1:Step-1:Open a GUI supported tool  Oracle s/w should be installed prior to the db creation
  Step-2:Go throw the home location and go to bin location
         ex:$cd /u01/app/oracle/product/19c/bin
  Step-3:In the dbca location we can given all the data init like dbname,password etc..

  ex: ./dbca -silent -createDatabase -templateName General_Purpose.dbc -gdbName rdsdbcas -sid rdsdbcas -sysPassword Welcome123$ -systemPassword Coke@123 -emConfiguration NONE -datafileDestination /u01/app/oracle/oradata -storageType FS -characterSet AL32UTF8
