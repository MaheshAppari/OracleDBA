##### Pfile&SPfile
Step-1:Location of the pfile and spfile
       *pfile...>init<SID>.ora
       *spfile..>spfile<SID>.ora


Step-2:There are two types of parameters
       *Static
       *Dynamic
       ex:select ISSYS_MODIFIABLE  from v$parameter where name='sga_max_size';.......it gives false......so it is STATIC
       
       ex:select ISSYS_MODIFIABLE  from v$parameter where name='sga_target';
       it is Immediate and Deferred.........so it is Dynamic

       Dynamic -  
       • IMMEDIATE- The change takes effect immediately. 
       • DEFERRED-  The change takes effect in subsequent sessions. 
        
       Static -  
       FALSE- The change takes effect in subsequent instances


Step-3:
