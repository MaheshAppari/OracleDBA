#### Patching
*In patching we have done it in two ways
  1.DB Patching
  2.GRID Patching

  **NOTE:Another step here ROLLBACK**
      ..ROLLBACK STATEMENT IS USED TO GET BACK THE PREVIOUS VERSION

 **Patching Steps
    1a.Pre Patch Phase
    2a.Patch Phase
    3a.Post Patch Phase

    1a.Pre Patch Phase
     **Patch Analysis by reading (readme.html)file
     **check current patches applied
     **opatch versi  on (if its updated version or not)
     **check patch conflicts
     **check the space of binary location
     **check invalid components and objects
     **Take a backup of binaries
     **Take a backup of database


     2a.Patch Phase
      **Disable moitoring
      **Stop all the services running on the home
      **Apply patch
         opatch apply
      **check the path version
         opatch lsinventory
      **Start all the services

     3a.Post Patch Phase
     **Run the postpatch script
        ./datapatch -verbose
     **Run utlrp.sql(if the count show any number)
     **Enable monitoring
     **checck the reote connectivity and handover the database to apps dba


1.DB Patching
  step-1:check the opatch version first.
  step-2:unzip the patching file in mount point location and change the OPatch to OPatch_bkp.
  step-3:unzip the remaing patching file in the home location.
  step-4:check the patch verion is increased or not.
  step-5:set the path in the location.
  step-6:check the patch conflicts and check the patch systemspace.
  step-7:stop the database and take the binary backups.
  step-8:then go to patch location in db level and give opatchapply.
  step-9:After that connect the dbagain and check comp_id and count(*)
          if it is 0 means no need of utlrp other wise we can run it.
 step-10:And then datapatch -verbose for the database update.



2.GRID Patching
   step-1:Pre patch 
         **Upgrade opatch tool version for RDBMS 
         **Upgrade opatch tool version for GI home
   step-2:Go through the root and change OPatch to OPatch_bkp
   step-3:unzip the file in grid home location and the version
   step-4:change the permissions from root to oracle to check space  
           and conflicts.
   step-5:come to oraclehome location set the asm loation and give the
           path location and grid home location their
   step-6:check the conflicts and the system space here connected to asm
        again.
   step-7:connect to root again and set the grid home location and grid
          Path.
   step-8:connect through asm db and give opatch auto apply and its location their it will be updated.
